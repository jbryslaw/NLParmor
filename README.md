# NLP armor

Software can contain 0-Day or hidden vulnerabilities which may allow malicious actors to gain access to secure areas in server memory. Some of the recent mega-breaches can be traced back to such vulnerabilities. Static analyzers, although easy to use, miss up to 60% of hidden vulnerabilities. Dynamic analyzers have a better detection rate, but are much more time consuming and require experts to run.

NLP Armor, utilizes strategies from natural language processing to quickly and effectively scan C++ functions for vulnerabilities. A custom python package, lex_utils, tokenizes C++ functions. These tokens are then inputted into an embedding layer in a convolution neural network. The CNN was trained on set of C++ functions labeled according to vulnerability. The trained CNN can then detect vulnerabilities in C++ code inputted by the user. NLP armor provides a better detection rate than static analyzers and is easier to use and less time consuming than dynamic analyzers.
